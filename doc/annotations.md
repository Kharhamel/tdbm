TDBM can read annotations to alter the generation of beans and DAOs.

If you have used annotations in the past, you are probably used to put annotations in your PHP documentation blocks.
But TDBM being a database-driven ORM, everything starts from the database. So TDBM will actually read annotations... from your database comments!

Right now, TDBM supports only one annotation.

The @UUID annotation
--------------------

By adding a `@UUID` annotation in your column comment, you inform TDBM that the column contains a generated random [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_1_.28date-time_and_MAC_address.29) value.

On object instantiation, TDBM will automatically fill the column with a random UUID. You would typically use this annotation in a primary key column.

```sql
CREATE TABLE `articles` (
  `id` varchar(36) NOT NULL COMMENT '@UUID',
  `content` varchar(255),
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
);
```

This will generate a bean with the following code:

```php
use Ramsey\Uuid\Uuid;

abstract class AbstractArticle extends AbstractTDBMObject implements \JsonSerializable
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();
        $this->setId(Uuid::uuid1());
    }
    // ...
}
```

### Choosing the UUID version

By default, **UUID v1** is used. UUID v1 is timestamp-based. Therefore, your database rows will be sorted according to the creation order (just like with an autoincremented ID).

However, this also means that your ID contains the creation timestamp of the field. If this is a sensitive information that you want to hide, you can instead use UUID v4.

To do so, simply use the `@UUID("v4")` annotation like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `articles` (
  `id` varchar(36) NOT NULL COMMENT '@UUID("v4")',
  `content` varchar(255),
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
);
```

The @Autoincrement annotation
-----------------------------

<div class="alert alert-danger">The @Autoincrement annotation is mostly useful with Oracle databases</div>

**You won't need this annotation if you are using MySQL or PostgreSQL.**

On some database platforms (namely *Oracle*), there is no native support for auto-incremented IDs. However, these can be "emulated" using a database trigger and a sequence.

However, when TDBM will read the model, it will not be able to understand that your column is auto-incremented via a trigger. So you have to tell TDBM that your column is auto-incremented manually. You do this by adding the `@Autoincrement` comment in the column description.

```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
  ID           NUMBER(10)    NOT NULL COMMENT '@Autoincrement',
  DESCRIPTION  VARCHAR2(50)  NOT NULL);

ALTER TABLE departments ADD (
  CONSTRAINT dept_pk PRIMARY KEY (ID));

CREATE SEQUENCE dept_seq START WITH 1;

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER dept_bir 
BEFORE INSERT ON departments 
FOR EACH ROW

BEGIN
  SELECT dept_seq.NEXTVAL
  INTO   :new.id
  FROM   dual;
END;
/
```
