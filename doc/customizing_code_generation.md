Code generator listeners
------------------------

When beans and DAOs PHP files are generated by TDBM a number of events are triggered.
You can hook on these events to add some specific code.

A few possible use cases:

- change the coding styles of generated beans and DAOs (maybe you don't like PSR2 and want something else?)
- generate one service per DAO in your favorite DI container (the `MoufDiListener` class does precisely that)
- generate a GraphQL schema out of the database model
- modify the code generated for one particular function
- dynamically add other generated functions
- ...

There are 2 interfaces you can implement to react on code generation.

- Implement [`GeneratorListenerInterface`](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/tdbm/blob/master/src/Utils/GeneratorListenerInterface.php) if you want to get a list of all beans/DAOs generated.
  This is useful if you want to auto-generate a container for instance
- Implement [`CodeGeneratorListenerInterface`](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/tdbm/blob/master/src/Utils/CodeGeneratorListenerInterface.php) if you want to **alter generated code**.
  For instance, the thecodingmachine/tdbm-graphql package uses this listener to add annotations directly
  in the beans.

Instances of `GeneratorListenerInterface` and `CodeGeneratorListenerInterface` must be referenced in the `Configuration` object.
