Deleting beans
--------------

Each DAO comes with a `delete` method to delete beans from the database.

```php
$userDao->delete($user);
```

When `delete` is called on a bean, the many-to-many relationships are automatically deleted as well.

###Cascading deletes

The `delete` method accepts a second `$cascade` parameter, that can be set to true is you want to perform cascade delete operations.

```php
// Delete $user and any bean that is pointing to the user.
$userDao->delete($user, true);
```

When using "cascading delete", any bean pointing to the deleted bean will be deleted as well.

Discarding changes on a bean
----------------------------

If your bean is coming from database, you can at any time cancel any changes you performed using the `discardChanges` 
method.

```php
$user = $userDao->getById(1);

echo $user->getName();
// outputs 'Foo'

$user->setName('Bar');

// Cancels any changes
$user->discardChanges();

echo $user->getName();
// outputs 'Foo' again, not 'Bar'
```


Cloning beans
-------------

You can clone beans using the `clone` keyword.

```php
$user = $userDao->getById(1);

$userCopy = clone $user;
```

Cloned beans have the following properties:

- The primary key of the cloned bean is set to `null`. This enables you to `save` the cloned bean easily (if you use auto-incremented primary keys).
- The cloned bean is "detached" from TDBM. You will have to call the `save` method of the DAO to save the bean in database.
- Many to many relationships are also passed to the cloned bean.

Logging and debugging
---------------------

TDBM uses MagicQuery to automatically guess the joins you want. If for some reason, the guess is bad, it can be quite
difficult to understand the request performed.

In these cases, you will want to enable logging.

For this, **you need to pass a [PSR-3](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/) compatible logger** as the 4th parameter of the `TDBMService` constructor.

TDBM can log quite a lot so by default, TDBM will restrict itself to only logging "warning" messages (or above).
If you enable logging of "debug" messages, you will see any SELECT request performed by TDBM.

For instance, to log a specific SQL request, you can do:

```php
use Psr\Log\LogLevel;

class UserDao extends AbstractUserDao {

	/**
	 * Returns the list of users starting with $firstLetter
	 *
	 * @param string $firstLetter
	 * @return UserResultIterator
	 */
	public function getUsersByLetter($firstLetter) {
        $this->tdbmService->setLogLevel(LogLevel::DEBUG);
        $results = $this->find("name LIKE :name", [ "name" => $firstLetter.'%' ]);
        $this->tdbmService->setLogLevel(LogLevel::WARNING);
        return $results;
	}
}
```

**Do not forget to register a PSR-3 logger in your `TDBMService`, otherwise, nothing will be logged!**
